sql was taken from Chromium's src/app/sql and a few
additional files were added for compilation

Changes:
  - Added files that sql depended on
  - Commented out checks and replaced them with ifs
  - Removed StringPrintf
  - Added utility functions for escaping and quoting SQL
  - Added to sql::Connection: BackupTo, BackupTemporaryTo and BackupDatabaseTo
  - sql::Statement::ColumnString defaults to "" NOT 0, caused error
  - sql::Connection invalidates all of its StatementsRefs not just cached,
    this allows statements to be static otherwise an error occures
  - Added overloads for when a std::string was supplied instead of const char*
  - Renamed OpenInternal to Open
  - Made connection and stmt in sql::Connection::StatementRef non-const
  - Made sql::Statement::GetSQLStatement const
  - Made Get functions in sql::MetaTable const
  - sql::MetaTable::DoesTableExist now uses reference not pointer
  - Added a few sanity checks
  - sql::Connection now uses SQLite's nested transactions not
    fake virtual-transactions
